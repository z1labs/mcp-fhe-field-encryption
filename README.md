# MCP FHE Field Encryption Module

## Overview

The MCP FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption) Field Encryption module provides enterprise-grade cryptographic capabilities for performing computations on encrypted data without requiring decryption. This module enables privacy-preserving data processing, allowing sensitive information to remain encrypted throughout its entire lifecycle while still being computationally useful.

## Core Architecture

### Encryption Schemes

The module implements multiple FHE schemes, each optimized for different use cases:

- **TFHE (Torus Fully Homomorphic Encryption)**: Boolean circuit evaluation with fast bootstrapping, ideal for binary operations and conditional logic
- **CKKS (Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song)**: Approximate arithmetic on real numbers, perfect for machine learning and statistical computations
- **BGV (Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan)**: Exact integer arithmetic with controlled noise growth
- **BFV (Brakerski-Fan-Vercauteren)**: Batched integer operations with SIMD-style parallelism

### Key Components

#### 1. Encryption Service
Handles field-level encryption with automatic scheme selection based on data type and computational requirements:

```typescript
interface EncryptionContext {
  scheme: FHEScheme;
  publicKey: Uint8Array;
  evaluationKey: Uint8Array;
  parameters: SchemeParameters;
}
```

The service maintains encryption contexts for active sessions, enabling efficient batch operations and minimizing key generation overhead.

#### 2. Homomorphic Operations Engine
Executes arithmetic and logical operations directly on ciphertexts:

- **Arithmetic**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, scalar operations
- **Logical**: AND, OR, XOR, NOT gates for boolean circuits
- **Advanced**: Polynomial evaluation, matrix operations, comparison circuits
- **Optimization**: Automatic operation reordering to minimize multiplicative depth

#### 3. Noise Management System
Critical for maintaining computation accuracy:

- **Noise Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of ciphertext noise levels
- **Bootstrapping**: Automatic noise refresh when approaching threshold
- **Modulus Switching**: Dynamic adjustment of ciphertext modulus to control noise growth
- **Key Switching**: Efficient transformation between different encryption keys

#### 4. Circuit Compiler
Transforms high-level operations into optimized FHE circuits:

```typescript
interface FHECircuit {
  gates: Gate[];
  depth: number;
  width: number;
  bootstrappingPoints: number[];
}
```

The compiler performs:
- **Gate optimization**: Minimizes circuit depth through algebraic simplification
- **Parallelization**: Identifies independent operations for SIMD execution
- **Bootstrap scheduling**: Strategically places bootstrapping operations

## Implementation Details

### Data Flow

1. **Encryption Phase**
   - Input data is analyzed for type and range
   - Appropriate FHE scheme is selected
   - Data is encoded into plaintext polynomial
   - Encryption produces ciphertext with metadata

2. **Computation Phase**
   - Operations are compiled into optimized circuits
   - Homomorphic evaluations execute on encrypted data
   - Noise levels are continuously monitored
   - Bootstrapping occurs when necessary

3. **Decryption Phase**
   - Final ciphertext is validated
   - Decryption recovers plaintext polynomial
   - Decoding extracts original data format
   - Result verification ensures computation integrity

### Performance Optimizations

#### Batching
The module implements SIMD-style batching for parallel operations:
- Packs multiple values into single ciphertext slots
- Enables vectorized operations across entire datasets
- Reduces encryption/decryption overhead by 10-100x

#### Caching
Multi-level caching strategy:
- **Key Cache**: Reuses evaluation keys across operations
- **Circuit Cache**: Stores compiled circuits for repeated computations
- **Bootstrap Cache**: Maintains bootstrapping keys in memory

#### Hardware Acceleration
Leverages available hardware optimizations:
- **AVX-512**: Vectorized polynomial operations
- **GPU Acceleration**: Parallel NTT/FFT computations
- **Multi-threading**: Concurrent ciphertext operations

### Security Guarantees

## Integration Patterns

### API Usage

```typescript
// Initialize encryption context
const context = await fheService.createContext({
  scheme: 'CKKS',
  precision: 40,
  scale: Math.pow(2, 40)
});

// Encrypt sensitive fields
const encryptedSalary = await fheService.encryptField(
  salary, 
  context
);

// Perform homomorphic operations
const encryptedBonus = await fheService.multiply(
  encryptedSalary,
  1.15  // 15% bonus
);

// Decrypt result (only with proper authorization)
const finalAmount = await fheService.decryptField(
  encryptedBonus,
  context.secretKey
);
```

### Circuit Definition

```typescript
// Define computation circuit
const circuit = fheService.createCircuit()
  .input('price')
  .input('quantity')
  .multiply('price', 'quantity')
  .add('taxRate')
  .output('total');

// Execute on encrypted data
const encryptedResult = await circuit.evaluate({
  price: encryptedPrice,
  quantity: encryptedQuantity,
  taxRate: encryptedTaxRate
});
```
